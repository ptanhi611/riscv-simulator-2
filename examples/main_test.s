# test_full_hazards.s
#
# This program is designed to test all data hazards WITHOUT
# any control hazards (no branches).
# It calculates a simple polynomial: y = ax^2 + bx + c
#
# It should produce:
# Mode 1 (No Hazard): WRONG result (will be 0)
# Mode 2 (Stall-Only): CORRECT result (x9 = 390), but VERY SLOW.
# Mode 3 (Forwarding): CORRECT result (x9 = 390), but MUCH FASTER.
